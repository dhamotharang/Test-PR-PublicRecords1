______________________________English Description of External Matching Process___________________________
 
SALT generated external matching is based upon the concept of LinkPaths which correspond to Roxie keys.
 
Each LinkPath consists of three sections :-
  -- Fixed - these fields must match perfectly (byte for byte) for a match to occur
  -- Optional - if present these fields must match; at least using fuzzy search criteria
  -- Extra Credit - if these fields match then points are allocated
Any search, or external matching request will then be analysed to see which fields are present in the query.
Based upon that analysis it is possible to determine which Fixed criteria could possibly match.
All of those linkpaths that could match will then be searched to see if a match exists.
If none of the linkpaths could possibly be satisfied then the UBER key will be used (described later).
Every matching record from every matching linkpath is then scored and then the scores are tallied by proxid.
The distance of the leading scorer from the rest of the possible matches then determines the confidence of the match (if any).
In the following each individual linkpath is described; brief descriptions of field level matching will be given.
More detail regarding the precise matching done on a field by field basis will follow and will be common for all linkpaths that use that field.

UBER Key
In order to trigger one of the linkpaths at least one of the following field combinations must exist in the input query:
cnp_name
cnp_name:st
prim_name:p_city_name:st
prim_name:zip
company_phone
company_fein
fname:lname
company_url
contact_email
source_record_id:source
if none of these conditions are met then the UBER key is used instead.
The UBER key is an inverted index; it will execute more slowly than the other linkpaths - but is more flexible.
For a record to match the UBER key it is required that every field in the input match the record exactly; but any combination of fields may be present.
 
The detailed scoring for the individual fields is the same from linkpath to linkpath and is as follows:-

__Glossary__
Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
 
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
 
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
 
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
