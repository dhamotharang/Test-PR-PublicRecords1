______________________________English Description of External Matching Process___________________________
SALT generated external matching is based upon the concept of LinkPaths which correspond to Roxie keys.
Each LinkPath consists of three sections :-
  -- Fixed - these fields must match perfectly (byte for byte) for a match to occur
  -- Optional - if present these fields must match; at least using fuzzy search criteria
  -- Extra Credit - if these fields match then points are allocated
Any search, or external matching request will then be analysed to see which fields are present in the query.
Based upon that analysis it is possible to determine which Fixed criteria could possibly match.
All of those linkpaths that could match will then be searched to see if a match exists.
If none of the linkpaths could possibly be satisfied then the UBER key will be used (described later).
Every matching record from every matching linkpath is then scored and then the scores are tallied by LNPID.
The distance of the leading scorer from the rest of the possible matches then determines the confidence of the match (if any).
In the following each individual linkpath is described; brief descriptions of field level matching will be given.
More detail regarding the precise matching done on a field by field basis will follow and will be common for all linkpaths that use that field.

must be present in the query and for a match it must be completely identical.
UBER Key
In order to trigger one of the linkpaths at least one of the following field combinations must exist in the input query:
LNAME:ST:C_LIC_NBR
LNAME:ST
LNAME:ZIP:C_LIC_NBR
LNAME:ZIP
LNAME:MNAME:ST
PRIM_RANGE:PRIM_NAME:ZIP
PRIM_NAME:ZIP
SSN
CNSMR_SSN
DOB:FNAME:LNAME
CNSMR_DOB:FNAME:LNAME
PHONE
C_LIC_NBR:LIC_STATE
VENDOR_ID:SRC
TAX_ID
BILLING_TAX_ID
DEA_NUMBER
NPI_NUMBER
BILLING_NPI_NUMBER
UPIN
DID
BDID
SOURCE_RID
RID
if none of these conditions are met then the UBER key is used instead.
The UBER key is an inverted index; it will execute more slowly than the other linkpaths - but is more flexible.
For a record to match the UBER key it is required that every field in the input match the record exactly; but any combination of fields may be present.
The detailed scoring for the individual fields is the same from linkpath to linkpath and is as follows:-
FNAME Scoring: Two FNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
  - if the two fields have the same metaphone handle
  - if the two fields have the same value for the function PreferredName
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the FNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 8 points.
It should also be noted that FNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
MNAME Scoring: If a field is null or an initial and another record in the same cluster has a fuller value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two MNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 2 edits (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the MNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 8 points.
It should also be noted that MNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
LNAME Scoring: Two LNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - if the two fields have the same metaphone handle
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the other
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the LNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 11 points.
It should also be noted that LNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
SNAME Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two SNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the SNAME
but should average 8 points.
It should also be noted that SNAME is a child field of FULLNAME. Therefore if FULLNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
GENDER Scoring: Two GENDER fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the GENDER
but should average 2 points.
PRIM_RANGE Scoring: Two PRIM_RANGE fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the PRIM_RANGE

Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
