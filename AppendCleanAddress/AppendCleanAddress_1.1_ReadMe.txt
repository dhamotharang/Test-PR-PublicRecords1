Append Clean Address HIPIE Plugin

This plugin uses the current Address cleaner library to take address columns, 
clean the address into standard components and append them to the 
dataset.

This plugin is typically used where you have Address columns with 
two address lines, city and/or state and zip.

Address1                  Address2                City         State       Zip
123 Main Street           APT 202B                Dullsville   MN          93922
2000 5th Street           SUITE 202B              Davis        CA          92929

This address would map to the following inputs for the plugin.
AddressLine1
AddressLine2
City
State
Zip

You can also clean addresses where it has two columns. One with the addresses line 
and the second with the City,St,Zip etc..

Address1                       Address2
123 Main Street, APT 202B      Dullsville, MN, 93922
2000 5th Street, SUITE 202B    Davis, CA, 92929

This would map to the following inputs for the plugin

AddressLine1
AddressLine2WithCity

The plugin will separate the Address into component parts and append them to the input dataset.

cachehit: True means that the address, in the format it was given existed in our 
          address cache. This means that we have seen it in that format before
          and that the clean address came from the cache and not the Address cleaner.
          
cleanerhit: True means that the clean address came from the Address cleaner.

Generally speaking, most addresses should be in the cache. If there is a high percentage
of addresses not hitting the cache then either it is because they are in a new format 
for those addresses (one we haven't seen or cleaned before) or they really are new addresses.
A new highrise or community of houses would cause this but it is unlikely they would all
be reported in the same input file at the same time for the first time.

CleanedAddress: formatted clean address, optionally you can make this a searchable link using the EnableSearchLink and SearchEngine options

InputAddress: formatted input address, optionally you can make this a searchable link using the EnableSearchLink and SearchEngine options

Formatted raw and clean addresses gives the user a clean way to view the raw and cleaned addresses side by side, which can be useful when we are asserting 
that we are having to correct addresses. 


Resource Requirements:

Requires the Address cleaner plugin to be available.
