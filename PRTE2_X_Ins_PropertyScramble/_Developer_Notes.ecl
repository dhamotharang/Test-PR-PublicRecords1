PRTE2_X_Ins_PropertyScramble._Developer_Notes
Note that the entire PRTE2_X_Ins_PropertyScramble module is used in DEV to prepare initial
Base files.  (Currently for PRTE2_Foreclosure, PRTE2_LNProperty and PRTE2_PropertyInfo)

Once the base file is prepared in DEV, the base file is imported in PROD.
SO this entire module is only needed in DEV and should never need to be promoted to PROD
