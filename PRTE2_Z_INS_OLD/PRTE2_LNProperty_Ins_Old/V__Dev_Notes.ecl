/*
The V_ Utilities filled pretty much all ASSESS code fields except standardized_land_use_code
They enhanced the old batch_in enough to give reasonable matching and then tied them to XREF, paired address, then production data.
NOTE: V_ utility ONLY read and updated ASSESSMENT type data.  The 250 or so DEED records that we had are still dirty or incomplete.
VV_Refresh_Data_After_UU can be completed and used to update more fields if we find we need them.
