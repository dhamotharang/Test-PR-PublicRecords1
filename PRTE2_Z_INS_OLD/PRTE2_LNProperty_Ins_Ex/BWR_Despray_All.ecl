??? Keep our 1 file and transform to 3???   or switch to 3 files????
If we keep our 1 base file - we'll have to 
   * save it as an initial base with 3 gen - that will be the spray/despray point
   * Post-spray process to transform out into 3 base files for Boca to use.
If we don't keep it and move to 3 - ????  any way to save our data?
