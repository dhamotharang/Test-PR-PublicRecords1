/*  
PSS = Phone Status Service, which is a new (as of March 2012) data source that is included 
as one of the many data sources used in the Work Place Locator (WPL) product related batch and
online services (See Batch_Services.WorkPlace_BatchService and 
WorkPlace_Services.Report & Search Services).

The PSS data is created from WPL Batch Service results data that has been sent to an outside 
(of Lexisnexis) company for phone# verification and then original data with verification 
status info has been returned to LexisNexis.  

The returned data is then used as a separate data source in the WPL services.

For more information (as of 02/29/2012) contact Emilie Peterson or Tom Sizer.
