				Thor Module			: FBNV2
				Frequency				: Variable due to when data is received from vendors.
				
				1.	The txt/csv/files on tapeload are to be copied into 
            the data directory under the appropriate fbn unix directory folder. 
				2.	Next, open FBNV2._BWR_Build_All in a builder window.  Change 
            the directory/filename path, filedate, and source to the appropriate values.  
            See examples below.

							FBNV2.BWR_Build ('/data/data_build_4/fbn/sources/ca/san_diego/20180212/RECL.P.OFFS.LEXI4201.VENDOR','20180212','San_Diego');
							FBNV2.BWR_Build ('/data/data_build_4/fbn/sources/ca/santa_clara/archive/20180206_FBN-Listing_20180102-20180131.csv','20180206','Santa_Clara');
							FBNV2.BWR_Build ('/data/data_build_4/fbn/sources/ca/ventura/archive/20180208/Ventura_FBN_R_Jan2018.txt','20180208','Ventura');
							FBNV2.BWR_Build ('/data/data_build_4/fbn/sources/fl/20171018/ficevt.txt','20171018','Event');
							FBNV2.BWR_Build ('/data/data_build_4/fbn/sources/fl/20171018/ficfile.txt','20171018','Filing');
							FBNV2.BWR_Build ('/data/data_build_4/fbn/sources/tx/harris/20170302/ASN*.txt','20170302','Harris');
 
				3.  Execute it.  The build will spray the input data as well as incorporate the latest 
            base records from BusReg, Experian, nd CP Hist Base records into the base records 
            of the FBN Business and Contact Bases.

            if it fails.

						1. Validates Source.
            2. Sprays the source to sprayed superfile.
            3. Standardizes the input, clears sources the cleaned superfile, and then adds the 
               standardized clean data to the cleaned superfile.
					  4. Maps the source.
            5. Runs Scrubs on Input Source and Reports Records with questionable fields.  (future)
            6. Maps BusReg, Experian, and CP Hist.
            7. Standardizes Addresses of the source and the Base Files.
						8. Builds Keys
						9. Builds Strata
						10. Runs BIPStats (future)
            11. Create QA Samples
						12. Updates DOPS via email.
