______________________________English Description of External Matching Process___________________________

SALT generated external matching is based upon the concept of LinkPaths which correspond to Roxie keys.

Each LinkPath consists of three sections :-
  -- Fixed - these fields must match perfectly (byte for byte) for a match to occur
  -- Optional - if present these fields must match; at least using fuzzy search criteria
  -- Extra Credit - if these fields match then points are allocated
Any search, or external matching request will then be analysed to see which fields are present in the query.
Based upon that analysis it is possible to determine which Fixed criteria could possibly match.
All of those linkpaths that could match will then be searched to see if a match exists.
Every matching record from every matching linkpath is then scored and then the scores are tallied by proxid.
The distance of the leading scorer from the rest of the possible matches then determines the confidence of the match (if any).
In the following each individual linkpath is described; brief descriptions of field level matching will be given.
More detail regarding the precise matching done on a field by field basis will follow and will be common for all linkpaths that use that field.

LinkPath L_CNPNAME_ZIP:
cnp_name:zip:?:prim_name:st:+:city:company_sic_code1:cnp_number:cnp_btype:cnp_lowv:prim_range:sec_range:parent_proxid:sele_proxid:org_proxid:ultimate_proxid:sele_flag:org_flag:ult_flag
In order for LinkPath L_CNPNAME_ZIP to be considered for matching the fields cnp_name and zip
must all be present in the query and for a match they must all be completely identical.
In addition for a record to be considered for scoring the fields prim_name and st
must all be identical, null or fuzzily equal.
Additional scoring points will be allocated for any of city,company_sic_code1,cnp_number,cnp_btype,cnp_lowv,prim_range,sec_range,parent_proxid,sele_proxid,org_proxid,ultimate_proxid,sele_flag,org_flag,ult_flag which match to any extent.

__Glossary__
Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters

Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.

Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.


__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
