/* TNT Verification levels
Bullseye – is currently the ‘best’ address and is a DID match to the gong file
*** The ultimate, full phone verification and other records pointing at that being best address too
Verified – is currently the ‘best’ address and is a HHID match to the gong file
*** Other records support this as the best address and the HOUSEHOLD has a phone registered at this line. Will pick up women with different lname to husbands
Current – is best address but not validated by the gong file
*** Self evident, works even when there is no phone indicator
Probable – is not currently the best address, but is did verified or hhid verified with a dt_last_seen within 6 months
*** Most likely because the best address is a mailing (only) address. This annotates the address with the active phone line out of ‘lived in’ addresses
Relative – is not currently the best address, and has a dt_last_seen > 6 months ago but is HHID verified
*** Probably identifies a situation where a family member moved out of the address
Historic – is not the best address and is not HHID or DID verified
*** A dead, historic address
