SEP 2017:
There is confusing stuff in various code attributes here until we can re-write some of this.
Originally we were told we had to take our base file and split it into 3 base files - then Terri saw that and said no -
We just had to convert our layout to the new layout and save one base file - then the Boca code would do the splitting.

12/1/16 - we'll have to re-write everything about our current LNProperty build
  1. transform our single base file into 3 base files (or maybe just rebuild new data with Boca PRTE data???)
  2. simple sprays/desprays
  3. generate final 3 base files to match Boca's versions.
