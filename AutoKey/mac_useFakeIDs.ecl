/* 

THIS MACRO IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO useFakeIDs (an old parameter to mac_build)
see documentation on gforge->ecl->docs->autokeys
https://gforge.seisint.com/docman/?group_id=21#

**** PARAMETERS DESCRIBED ****
--required
indataset 				- this is your file for which you want autokeys.  it will be built into the payload key.
outdataset				- this is your file with a FakeID field appended so that you may pass it in to AutokeyB2.Fn_Build
outaction 				- this holds the action of building and moving your payload key
inkeyname					- this is the string which is used to give your keys a name.  it should be unique to your dataset.
inlogical					- this is the string which is used to give your keys a logical name.  it should be unique to your dataset.
indid							- name of field either populated with real dids or with zeros
inbdid						- name of field either populated with real bdids or with zeros

--optional
useOnlyRecordIDs	- this is recommended.  it uses unique ids rather than dids and bdids that you pass in.  it prevents unintentional deep dive.
typestr						- only here for backward compatibility.  use default unless your build already has another typestr declared.
FakeIDFieldType		- only here for backward compatibility.  use default unless your build already has another FakeIDFieldType declared.
diffing						- only here for backward compatibility.  use default unless your build already has another diffing declared.
useunique				- not recommended unless you are having problems due to a very large dataset (and still maybe not recommended)
moveToQA					- old behavior is to only move to built, but i think that is silly.

--only used when useunique = true
uniqueid					- name of field populated with uniqueid for you particular dataset (such as corp_key)
