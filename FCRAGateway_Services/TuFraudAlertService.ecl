//This service was implemented in ticket RR-12334. The interface was kept as the G-ESP format for legacy compatibility.
//There was logic on the ESP layer which converted their T-ESP to G-ESP without going through roxie. Keeping the T-ESP
//interface required translating the ESP logic to ECL, and it was implemented a long enough time ago that questions
//could not be answered. It was decided to maintain the logic on the ESP layer as is.
