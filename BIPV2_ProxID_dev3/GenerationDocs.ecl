______________________________English Description of Matching Process___________________________
 
A SALT generated matching process really only contains one single matching rule.
SALT compares every record to every possible matching record and then allocates a score to how well
the records match. SALT then pairs those clusters which have the highest match scores provided the scores
meet or exceed the matching threshold. The scoring process is highly sophisticated and detailed below
however it can essentially be thought of as allocating points for every pair of fields that match
and subtracting points for every pair of fields that do not match.
This process was told to produce 3 nines of accuracy on a population of 200000000 with 1698496896 records.
The matching threshold is therefore set at 21.
 
___Field by Field Breakdown of Scoring Method___
 
company_name Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
cnp_name Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the cnp_name fields match.
Specifically the score awarded to this field must be >= 13 .
Two cnp_name fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - if the space seperated tokens in one match the other if re-arranged
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the cnp_name
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 25 points with a failed match substracting 23 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 6% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for cnp_name.)
 
cnp_hasnumber Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
cnp_number Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the cnp_number fields match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two cnp_number fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the cnp_number
but should average 12 points with a failed match substracting 12 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for cnp_number.)
 
cnp_btype Scoring: Two cnp_btype fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the cnp_btype
but should average 3 points with a failed match substracting 2 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 2% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for cnp_btype.)
 
cnp_lowv Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
cnp_translated Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
cnp_classid Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
company_fein Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two company_fein fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the company_fein
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 25 points with a failed match substracting 24 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 3% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for company_fein.)
 
company_foreign_domestic Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
company_bdid Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
company_phone Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two company_phone fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the company_phone
but should average 26 points with a failed match substracting 19 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 25% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for company_phone.)
 
iscorp Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two iscorp fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the iscorp
but should average 1 points with a failed match substracting 1 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for iscorp.)
 
prim_range Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the prim_range fields match.
Two prim_range fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the prim_range
but should average 13 points with a failed match substracting 13 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for prim_range.)
It should also be noted that prim_range is a child field of company_addr1. Therefore if company_addr1 is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_addr1, on average that will mean multiplying by 57%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
prim_name Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the prim_name fields match.
Two prim_name fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the prim_name
but should average 15 points with a failed match substracting 15 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for prim_name.)
It should also be noted that prim_name is a child field of company_addr1. Therefore if company_addr1 is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_addr1, on average that will mean multiplying by 57%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
sec_range Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two sec_range fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the sec_range
but should average 12 points with a failed match substracting 10 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 9% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for sec_range.)
It should also be noted that sec_range is a child field of company_addr1. Therefore if company_addr1 is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_addr1, on average that will mean multiplying by 57%
 
v_city_name Scoring: 
The scoring for this field is ignored unless the st fields are identical.
Two v_city_name fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the v_city_name
but should average 11 points with a failed match substracting 10 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for v_city_name.)
It should also be noted that v_city_name is a child field of company_csz. Therefore if company_csz is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_csz, on average that will mean multiplying by 46%
 
st Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the st fields match.
Two st fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the st
but should average 5 points with a failed match substracting 5 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for st.)
It should also be noted that st is a child field of company_csz. Therefore if company_csz is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_csz, on average that will mean multiplying by 46%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
zip Scoring: Two zip fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the zip
but should average 14 points with a failed match substracting 13 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for zip.)
It should also be noted that zip is a child field of company_csz. Therefore if company_csz is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_csz, on average that will mean multiplying by 46%
 
company_csz Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the company_csz fields match.
Specifically the score awarded to this field must be >= -2 .
Two company_csz fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
Note: company_csz is an amalgam of (v_city_name,st,zip)
Points will only be allocated for a match, the amount depending upon the scarcity of company_csz
but should average 14 points.
In the event of a non-match this field will score 0 (and the child fields will be allowed to score) and the sum of the scores of its' children will be used to determine the force criteria.
It should also be noted that company_csz is a child field of company_address. Therefore if company_address is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_address, on average that will mean multiplying by 67%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)

WV_foreign_corp_key Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the WV_foreign_corp_key fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two WV_foreign_corp_key fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the WV_foreign_corp_key
but should average 26 points with a failed match substracting 25 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for WV_foreign_corp_key.)
 
WY_foreign_corp_key Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the WY_foreign_corp_key fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two WY_foreign_corp_key fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the WY_foreign_corp_key

__Glossary__
Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
 
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
 
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
 
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
