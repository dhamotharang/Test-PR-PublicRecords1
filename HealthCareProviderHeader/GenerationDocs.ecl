______________________________English Description of Matching Process___________________________
A SALT generated matching process really only contains one single matching rule.
SALT compares every record to every possible matching record and then allocates a score to how well
the records match. SALT then pairs those clusters which have the highest match scores provided the scores
meet or exceed the matching threshold. The scoring process is highly sophisticated and detailed below
however it can essentially be thought of as allocating points for every pair of fields that match
and subtracting points for every pair of fields that do not match.
This process was told to produce 4 nines of accuracy on a population of 2000000 with   108667904 records.
A matching threshold of 34 is recommended although this was overridden to 45.
___Field by Field Breakdown of Scoring Method___
SSN Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two SSN fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - if the two fields have the same value for the function Right4
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the SSN
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 24 points with a failed match substracting 23 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 3% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for SSN.)
DID Scoring: Two DID fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the DID
but should average 23 points with a failed match substracting 17 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 22% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for DID.)
The SPC file has specified that the weight should be multiplied by  0.25
SRC Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
DOB Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the DOB fields not not match.
Specifically the score awarded to this field must be >= 3 unless one field is null.
If one or more components (year/month/day) of the field are blank then a value from a different record
in the same cluster will be used provided the other components match. eg DAY will propagate in cluster if year/month match.
Two DOB fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - if the YEARs are more than 13 apart then the whole record will be a no match.
  - if a Month or Day miss-match has a 01 on either side it will count as a 0 for that component
  - if the decade value differs by 1 it will be considered a fuzzy match
  - if the Year value differs by 2 it will be considered a fuzzy match
  - if the month component matches the day and vice-versi it will be considered a fuzzy match
  - otherwise each component of the score will be scored individually
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the DOB
but should average 17 points with a failed match substracting 17 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for DOB.)
SNAME Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two SNAME fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - if the two fields have the same value for the function NormSuffix
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the SNAME
but should average 8 points with a failed match substracting 7 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 1% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for SNAME.)
It should also be noted that SNAME is a child field of FULLNAME. Therefore if FULLNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FULLNAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 74%
FNAME Scoring: Two FNAME fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
  - if the two fields have the same value for the function PreferredName
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the FNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 8 points with a failed match substracting 7 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 3% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for FNAME.)
It should also be noted that FNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.

  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other

and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 8 points with a failed match substracting 7 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 6% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for MNAME.)
It should also be noted that MNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent MAINNAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 85%
LNAME Scoring: Two LNAME fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the other
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the LNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 11 points with a failed match substracting 9 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 12% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for LNAME.)

______________________________English Description of Cleaving___________________________
 Prior to performing matching all clusters are first assessed to see if they are presently overlinked.
A cluster is considered to be overlinked if it is possible to 'slice' or 'cleave' the cluster in such a way
that records either side of the slice completely differ in one or more fields; and their are 0 records
that 'straddle' the slice point (containing values characteristic of BOTH sides of the cleave point.
The particular characteristics of each cleave point follow:-
 Cleave point for basis:_NPI_NUMBER
A cleave point is considered to exist if it is possible to divide the cluster into groups each of which have
unique values for NPI_NUMBER
Unique means different in any way; no degree of fuzziness is allowed for.
Additionally for a cleave point to be considered there must be at least 2 records either slide of the cleave.
Once a cleave point is established two clusters will be formed composed of records that completely match the values of the cleave point. 
Any records left over will each be assigned their own cluster (exploded)
 Cleave point for basis:_UPIN
A cleave point is considered to exist if it is possible to divide the cluster into groups each of which have
unique values for UPIN
Unique means different in any way; no degree of fuzziness is allowed for.
Additionally for a cleave point to be considered there must be at least 2 records either slide of the cleave.
Once a cleave point is established two clusters will be formed composed of records that completely match the values of the cleave point. 
Any records left over will each be assigned their own cluster (exploded)

Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
