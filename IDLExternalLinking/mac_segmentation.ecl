/**
  This macro selects a LexID based on segmentation rules
		1. If results has more than Constants.GOOD_CANDIDATES_THESHOLD candidates within distance, 
			it is too ambiguous to select a good LexID
		2. If there is only one LexID tag as Constants.GOOD_CLUSTERS, this should be the LexID to return
		3. If there are more than one LexID tag as Constants.GOOD_CLUSTERS, but they are of high
		  confidence(name, ssn and dob match), select the LexID with the highest score.
		4. Make sure that if a LexID will be return the score for that LexID is greater than
			Constants.GOOD_SCORE if not (Constants.SCORE_SEG).
