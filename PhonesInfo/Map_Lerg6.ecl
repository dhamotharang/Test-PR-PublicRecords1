		/*Per Vendor - "COCTYPE" Field: Defines the use of the Central Office Code.  
			Used in conjunction with the SSC value to identify the "function" that the CO Code (NXX) or Thousands Block is performing by the party assigned the numbering resource.  
			•	ATC	= Access Tandem Code - used in Operator Services routing are considered a variation of Oddball Codes in that Rate Centers do not apply to them.  However, they are not included in the LERG6ODD file since, due to the need to provide the Operator Services Codes associated with them, they are listed separately in the LERG6ATC file.
			•	EOC	= End Office Code - used to identify a CO Code (NXX) or Thousands Block for which all line numbers, or a subset thereof, are used to provide Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS).  This is often referred to as “wireline” or “landline” and generally is considered the historically standard “telephone” voice service provided to residential and business customers.
			•	PLN	= Planned Code - non-routable.  Currently used infrequently by some companies to address situations that do not readily conform to other permissible values.  PLN codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	PMC	= Public Mobile Carrier (Type 2A Interconnected) - PMC identifies a CO Code (NXX) or Thousands Block that has been assigned as a (100%) fully dedicated Type 2A wireless interconnection.  
			•	RCC	= Radio Common Carrier (Dedicated Type 1 Interconnected) - RCC identifies a CO Code (NXX) or Thousands Block that has been assigned as a (100%) fully dedicated Type 1 wireless interconnection.  
			•	SIC	= Special 800 Service Code - This is used to indicate a non-dialable, but routable code.  For example, a customer dials a certain number that is then translated locally to a second number.  The second number would be then routed to, and would appear in BIRRDS with a COCTYPE of SIC.  SIC codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	SP1	= Service Provider Miscellaneous Service (Type 1 Interconnected) - SP1 identifies a CO Code (NXX) or Thousands Block that has been assigned as a (100%) fully dedicated Type 1 wireless interconnection for such services as Personal Communications Services (PCS).  
			•	SP2	= Service Provider Miscellaneous Service (Type 2A Interconnected) - SP2 identifies a CO Code (NXX) or Thousands Block that has been assigned as a (100%) fully dedicated Type 2A wireless interconnection for such services as Personal Communications Services (PCS).  
			•	TST	= Standard Plant Test Code - TST identifies a CO Code (NXX) that is needed to be shown for plant or other "testing" purposes.  This only pertains to non-pooled NXXs.  Test codes, specifically NXXs 958 and 959, unless they are assigned by the Code Administrator to a company, are generic test codes that can be used by multiple carriers.  They may also appear with a Rate Center value of XXXXXXXXXX and a SWITCH value of XXXXXXXXXXX and thus could be considered Oddball Codes.  TST codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	VOI	= Identifies a CO Code (NXX) or Thousand Block (NXX-X) that has been assigned for use as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to a SP identified with a NECA Company Code Category of IPES.
		
			(Oddball)
			•	AIN	= Advanced Intelligent Network – Usually a routing code (NXX) assigned to a SP offering a wide range of circuit switched services and utilizing elements of Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) platforms to determine proper termination of a call.  AIN codes may terminate to different locations dependent upon where the call originates, and requires a database application and/or query for processing.  AIN codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	BLG	= Billing Only – A non-ratable NXX used for billing purposes only.  These codes are used to generate bills, often for isolated and obscure call situations, but are not dialable or switched through the PSTN.  BLG codes cannot be ported or pooled
			•	BRD = Broadband – An NXX assigned for multiple Broadband service offerings.  Currently, these codes are not ratable in the PSTN; however, this is subject to change.  Subscriber bills for usage are generated for Broadband telephone numbers.  BRD codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	CDA = Customer Directory Assistance only (line number 1212) – This COCTYPE value is used as secondary means of flagging "555" (i.e., DA line numbers only, line number 1212).  NXX 555 line numbers, beyond x1212 for directory assistance are assigned by NANPA and are not applicable to this document.  NXX 555 line number assignment procedures (other than line number 1212) are addressed in ATIS-0300048 (formerly INC document INC 94-0429-002).  CDA codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	CTV = Cable Television – An NXX assigned for subscriber access to a cable television company.  The telephone numbers are usually assigned on a 7-digit basis, are ratable on a limited basis, and may be used to determine subscriber charges for selective viewing or special events.  CTV codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	ENP = Emergency Preparedness – A non-N11 NXX used for emergencies and disaster recovery (e.g. earthquakes, floods, etc.).  ENP codes cannot be ported or pooled.		
			•	FGB = Feature Group B Access – NXX 950. Used for trunk-side termination arrangements that provide FGB originating and terminating exchange access.  FGB codes cannot be ported or pooled.	
			•	HVL = High Volume – indicates an NXX from which the assigned company provides line numbers to address cases involving a high volume of calls over a short period of time (e.g. media promotional call-in requests, certain emergency and relief situations, etc.).  The NXX involved is not associated with a given Rate Center or switch.  Assigned HVL numbers may also often be referred to as “Mass Calling” numbers.  When an NXX is dedicated to a specific switch and Rate Center and is involved with “Mass Calling”, it would be considered non-Oddball and represented as COCTYPE EOC / SSC M (when some lines serve for “Mass Calling”) or COCTYPE EOC / SSC MO (when all assigned lines serve for “Mass Calling”).  HVL codes cannot be ported or pooled.
			•	INP = Information Provider – An NXX used uniquely for providing various “information services."  These include NXX 976 and “976 Like” codes.  “976” is reported assigned in an NPA when there is a state tariff (or other regulatory body decision) defining its use.  This includes “blockable” codes as defined by the New York Public Service Commission.  INP records with an SSC of T or W indicate that the entire NXX is dedicated to providers provisioning Time or Weather respectively and inclusively.
			•	N11 = NXXs 211 through 911.  N11 usage in the United States is defined by the FCC, which has formally addressed 211, 311, 511, 711, 811, and 911.  Similarly, in Canada N11 code use is defined by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
							211 – Community Support and Referral Services
							311 – Non-Emergency Government Services
							411 – Local Directory Assistance
							511 – Government Provided Traffic/Travel/Road Condition Report 
							611 – Repair Service
							711 – Telecom Relay Operator for Hearing/Speech Impaired
							811 – U.S. = One Call Services for Pipeline/Utility Excavations
										Canada = Non-urgent Health Care Telephone Triage Svc
							911 – Emergencies (Police, Fire, Ambulance, etc.)
							N11 codes cannot be ported or pooled.
							N11 use in other NANP countries is managed by the country’s regulatory authority; however, should such assignments exist or been made, the assignee in those cases may face some problems due to handling of N11 in call processing and in general telecom-related software, resulting in call-completion issues and related issues.   
			•	ONA = Open Network Architecture – An NXX assigned exclusively for ONA services.  The NXX may be dialable on a company-wide, region-wide, or other limited calling area.  ONA codes cannot be ported or pooled.			
			•	RTG = Routing Only – An NXX used by a SP for administrative or official calling purposes.  Assigned telephone numbers consist of the pseudo NXX and a four-digit line number.  Routing codes are dialable on a 7-digit basis only and are not associated, dialed, translated, nor terminated with a Home or Foreign NPA.  Such codes may terminate to multiple locations dependent upon where the call originates, and usually require 7-digit routing and code conversion in the translations process.  Routing codes are not rated.  RTG codes cannot be ported or pooled.			
			•	UFA = Unavailable for Assignment – Certain NXXs may be deemed unavailable for assignment to SPs for various reasons.  For example, NXXs may be protected in a specific NPA (withheld from assignment) due to certain characteristics and interrelationships between the NPA and NXXs involved, dialing plans, etc. – which, if assigned would create routing and rating conflicts.  NXXs may also be considered unavailable for assignment for various other reasons.
			•	700 = 700 IntraLATA Presubscription – dialing (home NPA)-700-xxxx is used for subscribers’ access into their presubscribed IntraLATA provider’s network.  x4141 is reserved to provide an indication to subscribers of the network to which they are presubscribed.  NXX 700 can only be assigned as a standard Central Office (CO) Code if the assigned company agrees to reserve x4141 for the indicated purpose.  This noted use of NXX 700 applies only the U.S. and its territories.  700 IntraLATA Presubscription codes cannot be ported or pooled.

			•	A	=	INTRALATA – for INTRALATA use only. 
			•	B	=	Paging Services – Information supplied by data providers regarding the “use” of an NXX or thousands block may vary over time due to a company’s line assignments.  
			•	C	=	Cellular Services – Information supplied by data providers regarding the “use” of an NXX or thousands block may vary over time due to a company’s line assignments.

			•	J	=	Designates that this NXX and/or thousands block has an extended/expanded local calling area.  
			•	M	=	Local Mass Calling – This is different than choke or high volume calling codes that are Oddball codes identified with a COCTYPE of HVL. 	
			•	N	=	Not Applicable – No SSC is needed, nor is one applicable.  Examples of types of services where an SSC of “N” is used may include Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), 9YY Service, Test Code, and Non-Geographic 5XX-NXX.	
			•	O	=	Other – When ”O” is used, there may be restrictions and/or special services that are otherwise not definable by an existing SSC value (e.g. “blockable” codes as defined by the New York Public Service Commission).  	
			•	R	=	Two-way Conventional Mobile Radio – This is a pre-cellular technology primarily used for situations where there needed to be two-way communications and an ability to patch to a phone.  	
			•	S	=	Miscellaneous Services – For example, Personal Communications Services (PCS), Voice Mail, etc.	
			•	T	=	Time – This is used if an entire thousands block or entire NXX is dedicated to providing a “time of day” announcement or service.  
			•	V	=	Internet Protocol Voice Enabled Services
			•	X	=	Service Provider requests Local Exchange /Company IntraLATA Special Billing Option.
						Indicates that there may be line numbers or thousands blocks assigned to a SP who has requested a LEC IntraLATA special billing option on a LATA-wide basis.  
			•	Z	=	Service Provider requests SELECTIVE Local / Exchange Company IntraLATA Special Billing Option.
						Indicates that there may be line numbers or thousands blocks assigned to a SP who has requested a LEC IntraLATA special billing option on a SELECTIVE Exchange basis.
