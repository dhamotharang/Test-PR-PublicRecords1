______________________________English Description of Matching Process___________________________

A SALT generated matching process really only contains one single matching rule.
SALT compares every record to every possible matching record and then allocates a score to how well
the records match. SALT then pairs those clusters which have the highest match scores provided the scores
meet or exceed the matching threshold. The scoring process is highly sophisticated and detailed below
however it can essentially be thought of as allocating points for every pair of fields that match
and subtracting points for every pair of fields that do not match.
This process was told to produce 3 nines of accuracy on a population of -2147483648 with 3000000000 records.
The matching threshold is therefore set at 41.

___Field by Field Breakdown of Scoring Method___

pflag1 Scoring:
Two pflag1 fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the pflag1
but should average 44 points with a failed match subtracting 43 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for pflag1.)

pflag2 Scoring:
Two pflag2 fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the pflag2
but should average 43 points with a failed match subtracting 42 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 2% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for pflag2.)

 1. Gather together all records that match on (did,src,data_permits) removing any which are invalid according to Watchdog_Best.fn_valid_fname.
 The number of each field value are then counted, field values with a smaller count are used to re-enforce higher count fields that they fuzzy-match to.

In the event of a non-match this field will score 0 (and the child fields will be allowed to score).



__Glossary__
Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters

Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.

Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.


__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
