/*
Also your routine BIPV2_Build.PRTE_BIPV2FullKeys_Package('20150420e').outputpackage that validates these keys. ïŠ  THANKS!

PRTE_BIP.PRTE_Proc_Build_BIP_Header_keys needs modified along with the associated prte_csv_bip_bh.* key layout member.

Let me know if you have any issues.  Also I am adding Kent Wolf since he is taking over the prte project in adding more products to the process.

Thanks,
