	Update Frequency		Weekly								
	Update Type		Unload								
	Expected Volume of Data		60,000 plus Corporation records; 250,000 plus Officials								
	Data Description		The state provides three downloads in CSV:  
						Corporations (which contains an unload of all business registrations), 
						Officials (contacts/officers) of the Corporation database and Agents. 
						As of January 2012, the Agents download is a duplicate of the registered 
						agent information that is now available in the Corporations download.  
						Thus registered agent information is not extracted from the Agents file.
