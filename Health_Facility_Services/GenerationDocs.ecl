______________________________English Description of External Matching Process___________________________
SALT generated external matching is based upon the concept of LinkPaths which correspond to Roxie keys.
Each LinkPath consists of three sections :-
  -- Fixed - these fields must match perfectly (byte for byte) for a match to occur
  -- Optional - if present these fields must match; at least using fuzzy search criteria
  -- Extra Credit - if these fields match then points are allocated
Any search, or external matching request will then be analysed to see which fields are present in the query.
Based upon that analysis it is possible to determine which Fixed criteria could possibly match.
All of those linkpaths that could match will then be searched to see if a match exists.
If none of the linkpaths could possibly be satisfied then the UBER key will be used (described later).
Every matching record from every matching linkpath is then scored and then the scores are tallied by LNPID.
The distance of the leading scorer from the rest of the possible matches then determines the confidence of the match (if any).
In the following each individual linkpath is described; brief descriptions of field level matching will be given.
More detail regarding the precise matching done on a field by field basis will follow and will be common for all linkpaths that use that field.

UBER Key
In order to trigger one of the linkpaths at least one of the following field combinations must exist in the input query:
CNP_NAME:ZIP
CNP_NAME
CNP_NAME:ST
PRIM_NAME:PRIM_RANGE:ZIP
PRIM_NAME:ZIP
PRIM_NAME:V_CITY_NAME:ST
PHONE
FAX
C_LIC_NBR:LIC_STATE
VENDOR_ID
TAX_ID
FEIN
DEA_NUMBER
NPI_NUMBER
NPI_NUMBER
CLIA_NUMBER
MEDICARE_FACILITY_NUMBER
MEDICAID_NUMBER
NCPDP_NUMBER
BDID
if none of these conditions are met then the UBER key is used instead.
The UBER key is an inverted index; it will execute more slowly than the other linkpaths - but is more flexible.
For a record to match the UBER key it is required that every field in the input match the record exactly; but any combination of fields may be present.
The detailed scoring for the individual fields is the same from linkpath to linkpath and is as follows:-
CNAME Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
CNP_NAME Scoring: Two CNP_NAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
  - if the space separated tokens in one match the other if re-arranged
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the otherand a hypen or space indicates a logical break in the shorter string
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the CNP_NAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 13 points.
It should also be noted that CNP_NAME is a child field of FAC_NAME. Therefore if FAC_NAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FAC_NAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 37%
CNP_NUMBER Scoring: Two CNP_NUMBER fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the CNP_NUMBER
but should average 13 points.
It should also be noted that CNP_NUMBER is a child field of FAC_NAME. Therefore if FAC_NAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FAC_NAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 37%
CNP_STORE_NUMBER Scoring: Two CNP_STORE_NUMBER fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the CNP_STORE_NUMBER
but should average 19 points.
It should also be noted that CNP_STORE_NUMBER is a child field of FAC_NAME. Therefore if FAC_NAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FAC_NAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 37%
CNP_BTYPE Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two CNP_BTYPE fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the CNP_BTYPE
but should average 4 points.
It should also be noted that CNP_BTYPE is a child field of FAC_NAME. Therefore if FAC_NAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FAC_NAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 37%
CNP_LOWV Scoring: Two CNP_LOWV fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the CNP_LOWV
but should average 5 points.
It should also be noted that CNP_LOWV is a child field of FAC_NAME. Therefore if FAC_NAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FAC_NAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 37%
PRIM_RANGE Scoring: Two PRIM_RANGE fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical

Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
