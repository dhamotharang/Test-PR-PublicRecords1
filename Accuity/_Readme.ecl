/*
There are two source files from Accuity found at
 \\tapeload02b\k\sanctions_patriot\accuity_watchlists_(en)\{version date}

MLPIDGWL.ZIP	-- This is a deliverable to XG Bridger and needs to be copied to the OUTPUT file

PIDGWL.ZIP		-- This contains the files used by the build process.
					These files need to be copied to edata12: /hds_3/accuity/{version date}
					ENTITY.XML
					extractsummary.txt
					GROUP.XML
					SRCCODE.XML

FullAccuityAKAlog.csv	-- this file is provided by XG Bridger (frequency TBD)
					The build process expects to find it here:
						/hds_3/accuity/akalist/FullAccuityAKAlog.csv


To run the process:
Accuity.Build_All({version date});   version date is yyyymmdd to match the date of the source
example: Accuity.Build_All('20121010');

This will create several output files at /hds_3/accuity/output on edata12
This is the list of deliverables:

Job Completion
When the job completes successfully, it will send an email with the workunit.
If it is unsucessful, an email will be sent to the DistributionList

There is one particular error that is checked for. If Accuity fails to provide a version date for
one of the lists, the following error message will be generated:

'The following list failed to build with listissuerdate=000000000000:  {listid}'

Someone on the distribution list will get in touch with Accuity to correct the problem.
