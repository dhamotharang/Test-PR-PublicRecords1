______________________________English Description of Matching Process___________________________
 
A SALT generated matching process really only contains one single matching rule.
SALT compares every record to every possible matching record and then allocates a score to how well
the records match. SALT then pairs those clusters which have the highest match scores provided the scores
meet or exceed the matching threshold. The scoring process is highly sophisticated and detailed below
however it can essentially be thought of as allocating points for every pair of fields that match
and subtracting points for every pair of fields that do not match.
This process was told to produce 3 nines of accuracy on a population of 200000000 with  6801149440 records.
A matching threshold of 38 is recommended although this was overridden to 30.
 
___Field by Field Breakdown of Scoring Method___
 
active_duns_number Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two active_duns_number fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the active_duns_number
but should average 28 points with a failed match substracting 27 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 2% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for active_duns_number.)
 
active_enterprise_number Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the active_enterprise_number fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two active_enterprise_number fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the active_enterprise_number
but should average 27 points with a failed match substracting 26 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for active_enterprise_number.)
 
active_domestic_corp_key Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the active_domestic_corp_key fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two active_domestic_corp_key fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the active_domestic_corp_key

hist_enterprise_number Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two hist_enterprise_number fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the hist_enterprise_number
but should average 27 points with a failed match substracting 26 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for hist_enterprise_number.)
 
hist_duns_number Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two hist_duns_number fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the hist_duns_number
but should average 28 points with a failed match substracting 27 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 2% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for hist_duns_number.)
 
hist_domestic_corp_key Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two hist_domestic_corp_key fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the hist_domestic_corp_key
but should average 27 points with a failed match substracting 25 points.

but should average 27 points with a failed match substracting 22 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 17% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for foreign_corp_key.)

  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - if the space separated tokens in one match the other if re-arranged
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the cnp_name

but should average 2 points with a failed match substracting 2 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for company_name_type_derived.)
The SPC file has specified that the weight should be multiplied by  0.00
 
cnp_hasnumber Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging

prim_name Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
prim_name_derived Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the prim_name_derived fields match.
Specifically the score awarded to this field must be >= 5 .
Two prim_name_derived fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the otherand a hypen or space indicates a logical break in the shorter string
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)

and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 13 points with a failed match substracting 12 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for prim_name_derived.)
It should also be noted that prim_name_derived is a child field of company_addr1. Therefore if company_addr1 is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_addr1, on average that will mean multiplying by 63%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
sec_range Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two sec_range fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the otherand a hypen or space indicates a logical break in the shorter string
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the sec_range
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 12 points with a failed match substracting 10 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 8% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for sec_range.)
It should also be noted that sec_range is a child field of company_addr1. Therefore if company_addr1 is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_addr1, on average that will mean multiplying by 63%
 
v_city_name Scoring: 
The scoring for this field is ignored unless the st fields are identical.
Two v_city_name fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the v_city_name
but should average 11 points with a failed match substracting 10 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 1% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for v_city_name.)
It should also be noted that v_city_name is a child field of company_csz. Therefore if company_csz is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_csz, on average that will mean multiplying by 46%
 
st Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the st fields match.
Two st fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the st
but should average 5 points with a failed match substracting 5 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for st.)
It should also be noted that st is a child field of company_csz. Therefore if company_csz is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_csz, on average that will mean multiplying by 46%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
zip Scoring: Two zip fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the zip
but should average 14 points with a failed match substracting 13 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for zip.)
It should also be noted that zip is a child field of company_csz. Therefore if company_csz is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_csz, on average that will mean multiplying by 46%
 
prim_range Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
prim_range_derived Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the prim_range_derived fields match.
 
Prior to matching the following rules are applied in a cascade in an attempt to fix or complete field values.
 1. Gather together all records that match on (cnp_name,prim_name_derived,v_city_name,st,zip).
 The number of each field value are then counted.
 The best is then defined to be the one which is unique.
 If the value generated is non-null and the value currently in the field is null then the value currently in the field will be replaced.
Two prim_range_derived fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the prim_range_derived
but should average 13 points with a failed match substracting 12 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for prim_range_derived.)
It should also be noted that prim_range_derived is a child field of company_addr1. Therefore if company_addr1 is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_addr1, on average that will mean multiplying by 63%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
company_csz Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the company_csz fields match.
Specifically the score awarded to this field must be >= -2 .
Two company_csz fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
Note: company_csz is an amalgam of (v_city_name,st,zip)
Points will only be allocated for a match, the amount depending upon the scarcity of company_csz
but should average 14 points.
In the event of a non-match this field will score 0 (and the child fields will be allowed to score) and the sum of the scores of its' children will be used to determine the force criteria.
It should also be noted that company_csz is a child field of company_address. Therefore if company_address is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_address, on average that will mean multiplying by 65%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)
 
company_addr1 Scoring: Two company_addr1 fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
Note: company_addr1 is an amalgam of (prim_range_derived,prim_name_derived,sec_range)
Points will only be allocated for a match, the amount depending upon the scarcity of company_addr1
but should average 24 points.
In the event of a non-match this field will score 0 (and the child fields will be allowed to score).
It should also be noted that company_addr1 is a child field of company_address. Therefore if company_address is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent company_address, on average that will mean multiplying by 65%
 
company_address Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the company_address fields match.
Two company_address fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
Note: company_address is an amalgam of (company_addr1,company_csz)
Points will only be allocated for a match, the amount depending upon the scarcity of company_address
but should average 25 points.
In the event of a non-match this field will score 0 (and the child fields will be allowed to score) and the sum of the scores of its' children will be used to determine the force criteria.
 
dt_first_seen Scoring: Date fields are not presently used for scoring but are carried along for debugging purposes
dt_last_seen Scoring: Date fields are not presently used for scoring but are carried along for debugging purposes
 
_AttributeFile Scoring_
Scores from attribute files are attributed to every potential record match between two clusters
All the field scoring and force restrictions specified above still apply. If multiple attribute fields match then their scores add.
 
The scores noted below may be thought of as bonus points.
 
Additional Scoring for fields source,source_record_id,vl_id from file SrcRidVlid:
 A score will be allocated for SrcRidVlid only in the event of an exact match, no penalty attaches to a no-match
The exact score will depend upon the global scarcity of SrcRidVlid but should average 27.
If multiple SrcRidVlid match for the same cluster pairing only the highest scoring 1 will apply.
There is no force condition on this attributefile so all mis matches are ignored.
Additional Scoring for fields company_charter_number,company_inc_state from file ForeignCorpkey:
 A score will be allocated for ForeignCorpkey only in the event of an exact match, no penalty attaches to a no-match
The exact score will depend upon the global scarcity of ForeignCorpkey but should average 27.
If multiple ForeignCorpkey match for the same cluster pairing only the highest scoring 1 will apply.
Every attribute value must match to a value in the other attribute IF they have the same context
 
Additional Scoring for field cname from file RAAddresses:
 A score will be allocated for RAAddresses only in the event of an exact match, no penalty attaches to a no-match
The exact score will depend upon the global scarcity of RAAddresses but should average 28.
If multiple RAAddresses match for the same cluster pairing only the highest scoring 1 will apply.
Every attribute value has to exactly match every attribute value of the corresponding identifier or both have no values
 
Additional Scoring for field pname_digits from file FilterPrimNames:
 A score will be allocated for FilterPrimNames only in the event of an exact match, no penalty attaches to a no-match
The exact score will depend upon the global scarcity of FilterPrimNames but should average 13.
If multiple FilterPrimNames match for the same cluster pairing only the highest scoring 1 will apply.
Every attribute value has to exactly match every attribute value of the corresponding identifier or both have no values
 
______________________________English Description of Cleaving___________________________
 
 Prior to performing matching all clusters are first assessed to see if they are presently overlinked.
A cluster is considered to be overlinked if it is possible to 'slice' or 'cleave' the cluster in such a way
that records either side of the slice completely differ in one or more fields; and their are 0 records
that 'straddle' the slice point (containing values characteristic of BOTH sides of the cleave point.
The particular characteristics of each cleave point follow:-
 
 Cleave point for basis:_active_domestic_corp_key
A cleave point is considered to exist if it is possible to divide the cluster into groups each of which have
unique values for active_domestic_corp_key
Unique means different in any way; no degree of fuzziness is allowed for.
Once a cleave point is established three clusters will be formed; two composed of records that match the values of the cleave point in any field, and one containing any records left over.
 
 Cleave point for basis:_cnp_number
A cleave point is considered to exist if it is possible to divide the cluster into groups each of which have
unique values for cnp_number
Unique means different in any way; no degree of fuzziness is allowed for.
Once a cleave point is established three clusters will be formed; two composed of records that match the values of the cleave point in any field, and one containing any records left over.

Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
 
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
 
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
 
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
