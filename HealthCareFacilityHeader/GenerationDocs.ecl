______________________________English Description of Matching Process___________________________
A SALT generated matching process really only contains one single matching rule.
SALT compares every record to every possible matching record and then allocates a score to how well
the records match. SALT then pairs those clusters which have the highest match scores provided the scores
meet or exceed the matching threshold. The scoring process is highly sophisticated and detailed below
however it can essentially be thought of as allocating points for every pair of fields that match
and subtracting points for every pair of fields that do not match.
This process was told to produce 4 nines of accuracy on a population of 1600000 with     7688562 records.
A matching threshold of 34 is recommended although this was overridden to 45.
___Field by Field Breakdown of Scoring Method___
UPIN Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging
NPI_NUMBER Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the NPI_NUMBER fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two NPI_NUMBER fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the NPI_NUMBER
but should average 22 points with a failed match substracting 22 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for NPI_NUMBER.)
DEA_NUMBER Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the DEA_NUMBER fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two DEA_NUMBER fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the DEA_NUMBER
but should average 21 points with a failed match substracting 20 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 3% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for DEA_NUMBER.)
CLIA_NUMBER Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the CLIA_NUMBER fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two CLIA_NUMBER fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the CLIA_NUMBER
but should average 22 points with a failed match substracting 22 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for CLIA_NUMBER.)
MEDICARE_FACILITY_NUMBER Scoring: Two MEDICARE_FACILITY_NUMBER fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the MEDICARE_FACILITY_NUMBER
but should average 21 points with a failed match substracting 17 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 14% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for MEDICARE_FACILITY_NUMBER.)
NCPDP_NUMBER Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the NCPDP_NUMBER fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two NCPDP_NUMBER fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the NCPDP_NUMBER
but should average 22 points with a failed match substracting 21 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 0% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for NCPDP_NUMBER.)
TAX_ID Scoring: Two TAX_ID fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the TAX_ID
but should average 21 points with a failed match substracting 20 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 3% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for TAX_ID.)
The SPC file has specified that the weight should be multiplied by  0.25
FEIN Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the FEIN fields not not match.
If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two FEIN fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the FEIN
but should average 17 points with a failed match substracting 16 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 2% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for FEIN.)
C_LIC_NBR Scoring: 
The scoring for this field is ignored unless the LIC_STATE fields are identical.
Two C_LIC_NBR fields will be considered to match if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)

and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 19 points with a failed match substracting 16 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 14% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for C_LIC_NBR.)
SRC Scoring: This field is not used for scoring; rather it is carried along for context and debugging

and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 13 points with a failed match substracting 9 points.
(This subtraction estimate is based upon 29% of clusters with 2 or more records have 2 or more values for CNP_NAME.)
It should also be noted that CNP_NAME is a child field of FAC_NAME. Therefore if FAC_NAME is a full match this field will score 0.
This field is scaled to match with its parent FAC_NAME, on average that will mean multiplying by 40%
(Although the score is still computed to satisfy the forcing condition.)

__Glossary__
Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
