    //       want the tool to ever return a "too many results" error.
    //       She was advised that when the number of records becomes
    //       larger than 10000, the results will not be repeatable.
    
    // NOTE: The People key (DemoSearchTool.Keys.people) and the Business 
    //       Legacy key (DemoSearchTool.Keys.businesses_bdid) will contain 
    //       both FCRA & nonFCRA data/records.  This is ONLY acceptable because 
    //       this is the PRTE environment.  Each of the respective keys will 
    //       have one record for FCRA and one for nonFCRA for each entity type 
    //       (Two records for each DID/BDID).  Additionally, an “FCRA” keyed 
    //       field was added as the first keyed field; which would eliminate 
    //       half the records immediately and help with performance.  
    //       This adopted change deviated from the initial proposal to add just 
    //       the FCRA compliant counts to the nonFCRA key (FCRA_bankruptcy_count, 
    //       FCRA_criminal_count, etc.).  However, going with the adopted changes 
    //       eliminated data fabrications concern that the counts from the FCRA 
    //       header files for the nonFCRA compliant fields/counts (such as 
    //       properties) could be different than the nonFCRA header file counts.  
    //       Implementing this approach also allows the Demo Search Tool to handle 
    //       both FCRA and nonFCRA from one service by having an isFCRA option 
    //       included as an input parameter at the user’s request.
