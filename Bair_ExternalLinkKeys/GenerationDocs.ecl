______________________________English Description of External Matching Process___________________________
 
SALT generated external matching is based upon the concept of LinkPaths which correspond to Roxie keys.
 
Each LinkPath consists of three sections :-
  -- Fixed - these fields must match perfectly (byte for byte) for a match to occur
  -- Optional - if present these fields must match; at least using fuzzy search criteria
  -- Extra Credit - if these fields match then points are allocated
Any search, or external matching request will then be analysed to see which fields are present in the query.
Based upon that analysis it is possible to determine which Fixed criteria could possibly match.
All of those linkpaths that could match will then be searched to see if a match exists.
Every matching record from every matching linkpath is then scored and then the scores are tallied by EID_HASH.
The distance of the leading scorer from the rest of the possible matches then determines the confidence of the match (if any).
In the following each individual linkpath is described; brief descriptions of field level matching will be given.
More detail regarding the precise matching done on a field by field basis will follow and will be common for all linkpaths that use that field.

The detailed scoring for the individual fields is the same from linkpath to linkpath and is as follows:-
NAME_SUFFIX Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two NAME_SUFFIX fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the NAME_SUFFIX
but should average 6 points.
It should also be noted that NAME_SUFFIX is a child field of FULLNAME. Therefore if FULLNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
 
FNAME Scoring: Two FNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
  - if the two fields have the same metaphone handle
  - if the two fields have the same value for the function PreferredName
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the FNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 9 points.
The SPC file has specified that the weight should be multiplied by  0.80
It should also be noted that FNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
 
MNAME Scoring: If a field is null or an initial and another record in the same cluster has a fuller value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two MNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 2 edits (see Glossary)
  - one is the leading part of the other
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the MNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 8 points.
The SPC file has specified that the weight should be multiplied by  0.80
It should also be noted that MNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
 
LNAME Scoring: Two LNAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
  - if the two fields have the same metaphone handle
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the other
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the LNAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 11 points.
The SPC file has specified that the weight should be multiplied by  0.80
It should also be noted that LNAME is a child field of MAINNAME. Therefore if MAINNAME is a full match this field will score 0.
 
PRIM_RANGE Scoring: Two PRIM_RANGE fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)

and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 11 points.
 
PRIM_NAME Scoring: Two PRIM_NAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - one can be turned into the other with 1 edit (see Glossary)
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the PRIM_NAME
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 11 points.
 
SEC_RANGE Scoring: 
The scoring for this field is ignored unless the PRIM_NAME fields are identical.
Two SEC_RANGE fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - if the two strings are identical if hypens and spaces are ignored
  - if one is the leading or trailing part of the other
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the SEC_RANGE
and the degree of fuzziness required but should average 8 points.
 
P_CITY_NAME Scoring: 
The scoring for this field is ignored unless the ST fields are identical.
Two P_CITY_NAME fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the P_CITY_NAME
but should average 10 points.
 
ST Scoring: Two ST fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the ST
but should average 5 points.
 
ZIP Scoring: Two ZIP fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the ZIP
but should average 14 points.
 
DOB Scoring: In order for two records to be a match it is also required that the DOB fields not not match.
Specifically the score awarded to this field must be >= 3 unless one field is null.
If one or more components (year/month/day) of the field are blank then a value from a different record
in the same cluster will be used provided the other components match. eg DAY will propagate in cluster if year/month match.
Two DOB fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical
  - if a Month or Day miss-match has a 01 on either side it will count as a 0 for that component
  - if the decade value differs by 1 it will be considered a fuzzy match
  - if the Year value differs by 3 it will be considered a fuzzy match
  - if the month component matches the day and vice-versi it will be considered a fuzzy match
  - otherwise each component of the score will be scored individually
The exact number of points allocated to a match will depend upon the global scarcity of the DOB
but should average 15 points.
 
PHONE Scoring: If a field is null and another record in the same cluster has a value for that field then the other records value will be used.
Two PHONE fields will be considered to match in optional or extra credit positions if:
  - they are identical

__Glossary__
Edit Distance: An edit distance of (say) one implies that one string can be converted into another by doing one of
  - Changing one character
  - Deleting one character
  - Transposing two characters
 
Forcing Criteria: In addition to the general 'best match' logic it is possible to insist that
one particular field must match to some degree or the whole record is considered a bad match.
The criterial applied to that one field is the forcing criteria.
 
Cascade: Best Type rules are applied in such a way that the rules are applied one by one UNTIL the first rule succeeds; subsequent rules are then skipped.
 
__General Notes__
How is it decided how much to subtract for a bad match?
SALT computes for each field the percentage likelihood that a valid cluster will have two or more values for a given field
this value (called the switch value in the SALT literature) is then used to produce the subtraction value from the match value.
The value in this document is the one typed into the SPC file; the code will use a value computed at run-time.
